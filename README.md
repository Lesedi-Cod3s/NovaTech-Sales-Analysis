### **Project Background**

Our company operates in the **retail and technology sector**, leveraging a **business-to-consumer (B2C) model** to distribute high-demand consumer products globally. Established over a decade ago, we have consistently grown into an industry leader with a focus on cutting-edge technology, diverse product categories, and a robust regional presence across North America, Europe, APAC, and emerging markets.

Key metrics that define our business include:

- Annual global revenue exceeding $10M.
- Focus on profitability goals, aiming for a **20% profit margin** across all regions.
- A data-driven approach to optimize sales, shipping, and regional performance.

As a **data analyst**, I am tasked with identifying trends, uncovering insights, and providing actionable recommendations across product categories, regional performance, seasonal trends, shipping optimizations, and customer segmentation.

The following report provides detailed insights and recommendations in these critical business areas based on historical performance data, sales trends, and shipping metrics.

### **Executive Summary**

### **Overview of Findings**

1. **Technology Leads Sales Globally:** Technology is our top-performing category, generating $4.7M in sales and $663.8K in profit, with **Phones** as the dominant subcategory. However, product returns and unprofitable items present risks requiring mitigation.
2. **APAC Sales Underperform Profit Goals:** APAC generated $3.59M in sales but fell 39.2% short of profitability goals. While the **Consumer segment** drives most sales, cost reductions and market-specific campaigns are necessary to improve profitability.
3. **Seasonal Peaks in Q4:** Sales peak for all years in December, November, September, and June, with the **fourth** **quarter (Q4)** contributing significantly due to holiday demand. **First quarter (Q1)** sales consistently lag behind, suggesting opportunities to optimize inventory management.
4. **Shipping Challenges:** Standard Class shipments dominate but lack profitability, and weekends show minimal shipping activity. Optimizing shipping costs and exploring weekend operations could yield significant improvements.

### **Assumptions**

**Profit Rounding**: Due to rounding profits to whole numbers, some products may display a profit of $0, despite having a fractional profit value.

**2015 Data Limitation**: Data from 2015 was excluded from certain visuals, as it only represents less than 30 recorded days and does not provide significant value to the overall analysis.
